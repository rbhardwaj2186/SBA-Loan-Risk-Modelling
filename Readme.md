## Project SBA Loan Risk Modelling

**Here are some tips for submitting your project. You can use the points as partial check list before submission.**

- **Give your notebook a clear and descriptive title.** 
- **Explain your work in Markdown cells.** This will make your notebook easier to read and understand. You can use different colors of font to highlight important points.
- **Remove any unnecessary code or text.** For example, you should not include the template for training and scoring in your final submission.
- **Package your submission in a single file.** I will deduct points for multiple files or incorrect folder structure.
- **Name your notebooks correctly.** Include your name and Net-ID in the file name.
- **Train your TE/WOE encoders on the training set only.** You can train them on the full dataset for your final model.
- **Test your scoring function.** Most students scoring functions in the past din't work, so make sure to test yours before submitting your project.
- **Avoid common mistakes in your scoring function.** For example, your scoring function should not:
  - drop records, expect the target to be passed
  - fit TE/WOE/Scalers
  - return anything other than a Pandas DF.
- **Make sure you have the required number of engineered features.** 
- **Don't create features and then not use them in the model**, if there is a reason not to use the feature in the model, explain.
- **Don't include models in your notebook that you didn't train.** This is considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero for the project.
- **Consistently display model performance metrics.** Use AUC or AUCPR for all models and iterations, and don't switch between metrics. For sure don't use accuracy, it is misleading metric for the imbalanced datasets. 
- **Discuss your model results in a Markdown cell.** Don't just print the results; explain what they mean.
- **Include a conclusion section in your notebook.** This is your chance to summarize your findings and discuss the implications of your work.
- **Treat your notebook like a project report that will be read by your manager who can't read Python code.** Make sure your notebook is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- **Display a preview of your dataset that you used for training.** This will help me understand what features you used in your model.
- **Use the libraries versions specified on eLearning.** For example, you should use H2O 3.42.0.2  
- **Use Python 3.10.11.** If you use another version and your code doesn't work on 3.10.11, it will be considered a bug in your code.
- **When running H2O and want to suppress long prints (for example model summary), include ";" at the end of the command.**
- **Don't include the dataset with your deliverables.**
